# Multiclass-Seizure-Classification
** Seizure Type Classification using Statistical Variants and Machine Learning **
This repository contains the implementation of a seizure type classification model based on statistical variants and machine learning techniques, as described in the paper titled "Classification of Seizure Types Based on Statistical Variants and Machine Learning".

Dataset
The model is built using a publicly available EEG dataset contributed by Temple University Hospital (TUH). While the dataset is publicly available, access requires university credentials, and data request procedures must be followed.

Implementation
The model described in the paper has been implemented in this repository. The code includes preprocessing steps, feature extraction based on statistical variants, and the application of machine learning algorithms for classification.

How to Use
To use this repository:

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the EEG dataset from TUH.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Follow the instructions provided in the code documentation to set up the environment and preprocess the dataset.
Implement the model mentioned in the paper by following the code structure provided.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize the classification performance.
Report any issues or suggestions for improvement via GitHub issues.
